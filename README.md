This repo contains files for my progress in learning the following programming languages:

- [Python](https://www.python.org): An interpreted, simple programming language. Famous for it's ease of use.
- [V](https://vlang.io): A fast C-like language that compiles fast. It has many proof-of-concept projects, in my research [vinix](https://github.com/vlang/vinix) looks pretty cool.

## Extensions used (VSCode)
- Python: ``Python`` by ``Microsoft``
- V: ``v-analyzer`` by ``VOSCA``, ``file-icons`` by ``file-icons``
